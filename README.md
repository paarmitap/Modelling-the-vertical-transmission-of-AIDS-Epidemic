# Modelling-the-vertical-transmission-of-AIDS-Epidemic
Our project work is based on the Research paper Naresh et. all (2006). In this project, we analyze a non-linear mathematical model of the spread of HIV/AIDS in a population of varying size with immigration of population . We find the equilibrium points of the model system and determined their stability graphically. The model exhibits two equilibria namely, the disease-free and the endemic equilibrium. The equilibrium point stability and existence depends on the value of basic reproduction rate. The bifurcation point has been identified and plotted. We numerically analyse and explain the dependence of the system on various parameters, and elaborate on how the parameters can be varied to control the epidemic.
